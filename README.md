# Tactile Image Web App:

## What is this?:
This is a version of the CLI application viewable [here](https://github.com/wwu-webtech/Tactile_Patterns). This project is currently under my personal github account but will be moved to the WWU account when they are ready.

## Installation and Use:

Start by installing python, which can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or by running ```sudo apt install python```. Next run ```git clone https://github.com/velo1guy/tactile_patterns_web.git```. Once this has been done succsessfully, enter this directory, and in the ```azure_tactile``` subdirectory, run ```python -m venv venv```. Then run ```source venv/bin/activate``` and your virtual enviornment should be set up. Once in the venv, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```, and your requirments should be installed.
